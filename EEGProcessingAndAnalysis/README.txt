This folder contains the analysis pipeline developed to investigate the neural signals that occurred in the participants' brain as they completed the experimental paradigm. 

The 'Figures' folder contains the figures seen in the dissertation for each of the analysis sections.

The 'analysisCode' folder contains all of the code for each of the different ERPs calculated as part of the pipeline. It also contains code for reading in the EEG BDF files and preprocessing the data. All of this is automated to enable easy expansion.

The 'datasets' folder contains the .mat files that contains the different types of preprocessed EEG and stimulus data for each participant. However, the majority of this data was not possible to upload on GitHub. Therefore it contains data used during the analysis such as the experiment results and word onset timings.

The 'libs' folder contains all of the libraries used during the analysis pipeline.
