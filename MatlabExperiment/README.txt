Instructions on making audios:

1) Change the chosen words and meanings in visual studio
2) Run the visual studio code
3) Copy the sequences produced into the sequences folder and name based on the meanings i.e. CowPig_Sequences
4) Copy the output from the visual studio code into Matlab to create the audios and get the silences/ audio lengths
5) Use the Text-To-Speech to get the speech versions of the words in the chosen words vector 
6) Copy the MP3 TTS files into the MP3 folder and then convert them to WAVs and copy the WAVs into the WAV folder
7) Read in the WAV files to Matlab in the same order as in the chosen words vector
8) Run the Matlab code 
9) Listen to some of the sequences and check they match the sequences generated
10) Copy the length of silences and length of audio files into the correct folders in visual studio
